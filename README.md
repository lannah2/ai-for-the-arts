## Task: Write about the Purpose of a Repository.
Repositories are effective in writing, storing, sharing, and duplicating information and files without compromising the original data. They allow different versions of a file to be distributed and collaborated on, whilst actively mainting the initial document.

## Task: Write about the Purpose of your Repository
The purpose of my repository is to create a portfolio of my lab tasks which can be shared, copied and editied, whilst marking the progress of my understanding of GitHub and Artificial Intelligence for the Arts and Humanities.

## Task: Write about your Goals for the End of the Course.

By the end of this course, I would like to obtain a sufficient level of understanding on the main principles within Artificial Intelligence and its History.
