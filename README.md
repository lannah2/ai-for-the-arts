# ***AI for the Arts and Humanities Portfolio***

## GUID: 2800636

## Task: Write about the Purpose of a Repository.
Repositories are effective in writing, storing, sharing, and duplicating information and files without compromising the original data. They allow different versions of a file to be distributed and collaborated on, whilst actively mainting the initial document.

## Task: Write about the Purpose of your Repository
The purpose of my repository is to create a portfolio of my lab tasks which can be shared, copied and edited, whilst simultaneously marking the progress of my understanding of GitHub coding and Artificial Intelligence within the Arts and Humanities.

## Repository Content
### This Repository Includes 3 Notebooks:
- Coding Exercises
- Machine Learning from Start to End
- Proposal of a Large Language Model Application

The purpose of these notebooks is to display my development of python coding, training machine learning models, and to cement my understanding of how such models can be implemented in a real-life manner.

## Task: Write about your Goals for the End of the Course.

By the end of this course, I would like to obtain a sufficient level of understanding on the main principles within **Artificial Intelligence** and its History.

I would also like to expand my knowledge on the concept of **machine learning**, and how it utilises data in order to function.

Furthermore, I would like to accquire the ability to comprehend different types of **AI models** and how to use them in a project.

I aim to obtain a deeper understadning of the language utilised in **Python Coding**, and develop the foundations and skills required to construct a portfolio which demonstrates such code.

## Task: Create a bulleted list of goals
- Develop a greater understanding of the history of AI
- Create a well-rounded, concise portfolio of each weeks tasks, demonstrating the  practical skills and knowledge I have obtained from the course.
- Learn to comprehend and utilise basic programming concepts in GitHub Codespaces
- Improve my ability to read existing code
- Expand my knowledge on machine learning programmes
- Engage with a range of current developments in AI and associated applications
- Possess the ability to analyse the social impacts of AI applications
