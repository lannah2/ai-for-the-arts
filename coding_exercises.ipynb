    "\n",
    "### Upon utilising Copilot for Python coding for the fist time, here are some of the benefits:\n",
    "- Copilot is effective in locating and rectifying errors within code.\n",
    "- It is significantly faster at generating code than a human would be.\n",
    "- It possesses the ability to \n",
    "It provides examples which are related to your specific code.\n",
    "- It offers a plethora of different solutions until you find one that is suitable to your unique problems. this also allows users to learn a variety of different coding techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are some of the limitations I encountered:\n",
    "- It is not always 100% accurate.\n",
    "- Continously requesting Copilot to generate code may prevent the user from actually learning the skill themselves.\n",
    "- It cannot always completely comprehend specific circumstances, and therefore, the provided code may not be relevant enough.\n",
    "- It provides a restricted explanation as to why certain code needs to be utilised in certain situations."
